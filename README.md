## Development Info

This is a bare-bones Nuxt environment for the purpose of the front end code exercise. It is intentional that there are no linters or extra code validations included (eslint, prettier, etc) for the sake of being able to focus on the exercise without opinionated compile errors. Feel free to add/include them if you prefer to have them while working. Inclusion of them will not have any affect on how we assess the exercise.

We care about observing clean, well-organized, and working code. How you get it there is up to you. Have fun!
